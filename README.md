QA Bot Project
This repository contains a Question Answering (QA) bot that provides interactive answers about clean energy using the Cohere language model and Pinecone for efficient search. The bot is built using Streamlit to create an easy-to-use interface and Ngrok to make the app accessible online.

The QA Bot is an AI-driven tool that leverages advanced NLP techniques to answer questions about clean energy. It integrates Pinecone for semantic search, Cohere for language generation, and Streamlit to build the user interface.

Features
Interactive Q&A: Users can type in questions about clean energy and receive detailed responses.
Context Retrieval: Uses Pinecone to retrieve relevant paragraphs from indexed content.
AI-Generated Answers: Uses Cohere to generate answers to user questions based on the retrieved context.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/qa-bot.git
cd qa-bot
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install the required Python packages by running:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the project directory and add your API keys and tokens:

env
Copy code
PINECONE_API_KEY=87a3914b-75ee-4c0c-b4cf-b294158e0747
COHERE_API_KEY=omTyaHvoeFTz8JelXtrfXxdal0FFkvMVK4UDAKff
NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=2nC5Cc0NH5B31IE9mh8DUIoFGsf_4TcVQUEWpwg11QwygusvY
Load Environment Variables in your Python script: Add this snippet at the start of your script to load environment variables:

python
Copy code
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

pinecone_api_key = os.getenv("PINECONE_API_KEY")
cohere_api_key = os.getenv("COHERE_API_KEY")
ngrok_auth_token = os.getenv("NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN")
Running the Bot
Run the Streamlit App: To start the Streamlit application, run:

sh
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Expose the App Online with Ngrok: Open a new terminal and start Ngrok to expose your app to the internet:

sh
Copy code
ngrok http 8501
Copy the public URL provided by Ngrok to access the bot from anywhere.

Usage
Open the provided Ngrok link or run the app locally.
You will see a text input box where you can type in your question about clean energy.
The bot will retrieve the best paragraph from the indexed content and generate a detailed answer.
Deployment Instructions
Deploy on GitHub:

Commit your code to your Git repository.
Use Git commands (git add ., git commit -m "Message", git push) to push changes to GitHub.
Deploy on a Cloud Platform: If you want a permanent deployment, consider using cloud services like:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Heroku (free and easy deployment option).
Use Docker to containerize the application:

Create a Dockerfile that includes all dependencies.
Push the Docker image to a Docker registry.
Deploy it using your preferred cloud provider.
Documentation
Pipeline Overview
Document Upload: A text document about clean energy is loaded.
Splitting Text: The document is split into smaller paragraphs for easy search.
Embedding Generation: Each paragraph is embedded using the SentenceTransformer model.
Pinecone Indexing: Paragraphs are indexed in Pinecone for semantic search.
User Query:
User asks a question.
Pinecone retrieves the most relevant paragraph.
Cohere generates a detailed answer based on the paragraph and question.
Display Answer: The answer is displayed on the Streamlit web app.
Deployment Details
Streamlit App: Provides a simple user interface to interact with the QA bot.
Ngrok: Used to expose the local app to the internet, making it accessible to others.
Pinecone & Cohere: Used for efficient retrieval and language generation.
Contributing
Issues: Please open issues if you find bugs or have feature requests.
Pull Requests: Feel free to create pull requests for any new feature implementation or bug fix.











Documentation on the Pipeline and Deployment Instructions
Pipeline Documentation:
Data Preparation:

A text document (clean-energy-index.txt) is loaded.
It is split into smaller parts for indexing.
Embedding and Indexing:

Each paragraph is converted into vector embeddings using SentenceTransformer.
These embeddings are indexed into Pinecone for efficient retrieval during user queries.
Query Processing:

When a user types a question, it is converted to an embedding.
Pinecone is queried for the most relevant content.
Answer Generation:

The best-matched content is fed to Cohere, along with the user's question.
A response is generated, which is then displayed to the user.
Deployment Instructions:
Local Deployment:

The application is built in Python using Streamlit for the UI.
Pinecone and Cohere services are accessed through their respective APIs.
Ngrok is used to create a public-facing URL, making the locally running Streamlit app accessible.
Cloud Deployment:

Create a Dockerfile to containerize your application.
Deploy the container on cloud services like AWS, GCP, Azure, or Heroku.
Alternatively, you can use GitHub Actions for CI/CD to deploy automatically whenever changes are made.
